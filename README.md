## Introduction
`serversideup/github-cli` is a lightweight solution for running GitHub CLI via Docker.

## Features
- üêß **Debian and Alpine** - Choose your OS
- üîí **Unprivileged user** - Choose to run as root or an unprivileged user
- üìå **Pinned GitHub CLI Version** - Set your GitHub CLI version down to the patch version
- üîß **Customize your "run as" user** - Customize the username to run as
- üîë **Set your own PUID and PGID** - Have the PUID and PGID match your host user
- üì¶ **DockerHub and GitHub Container Registry** - Choose where you'd like to pull your image from
- ü§ñ **Multi-architecture** - Every image ships with x86_64 and arm64 architectures

## Usage
Getting started is easy. Here's a few tips on how to use this image.

### Choose your registry

Our images are available on Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry ü•≥

**DockerHub:**
- [serversideup/github-cli](https://hub.docker.com/r/serversideup/github-cli)

**GitHub Container Registry:**
- [ghcr.io/serversideup/github-cli](https://github.com/serversideup/docker-github-cli/pkgs/container/github-cli)

| Variation | Image Size |
| --------- | -------------------- |
| `serversideup/github-cli` | [![DockerHub serversideup/github-cli:alpine](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/serversideup/github-cli/alpine?label=alpine)](https://hub.docker.com/r/serversideup/github-cli/tags?name=alpine)<br>[![DockerHub serversideup/github-cli](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/serversideup/github-cli/latest?label=debian)](https://hub.docker.com/r/serversideup/github-cli)

### Mounting directories
There are a few directories that we need to mount to ensure everything works correctly.

#### Mounting the `/config` directory
In order to authenticate with GitHub, we need to mount your `~/.config` directory from your host into the container. We have a special `/config` directory that is symbolically linked from the unprivileged user's home directory. We use this root directory so you can change the `RUN_AS_USER` environment variable and not have to worry about having to predict what the absolute path to the configuration directory is. 

For example, if you rename the `RUN_AS_USER` to something like `bob`, `/home/bob/.config` will be symbolically linked to `/config`, giving you a predictable path to mount your configuration files.

#### Working with SSH
SSH also behaves in a similar way. Keep reading below for more details.

#### Mounting the `/workdir` directory
We also have a `/workdir` directory that is intended for you your workspace.

### Change the "run as" user, PUID and PGID

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$HOME/.ssh:/ssh:ro" \
  -v "$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts:/ssh/known_hosts:rw" \
  -v "$(pwd):/workdir" \
  -v "$HOME/.config/gh:/config/gh:rw" \
  -e "PUID=9999" \
  -e "PGID=9999" \
  -e "RUN_AS_USER=bob" \
  serversideup/github-cli:latest gh --version
```

### Run a shell
```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$HOME/.ssh:/ssh" \
  -v "$(pwd):/workdir" \
  serversideup/github-cli:latest /bin/sh
```

### Working with SSH
> [!NOTE]  
> Working with SSH keys can be tricky, especially if we're setting a `RUN_AS_USER` dynamically. We created a few things to help reduce the headache of getting this configured.

#### The `/ssh` directory
By default, we have a `/ssh` directory that is symbolically linked from `~/.ssh`. The `/ssh` directory is used as our single source of truth for SSH keys and configurations.

If you set `RUN_AS_USER`, the entrypoint will create a home directory at `/home/${RUN_AS_USER}`, then create a symbolic link from `/home/${RUN_AS_USER}/.ssh` to `/ssh`. This gives you the power to set your `RUN_AS_USER` to anything you want without us needing to predict what user you want to run as.

#### Mounting the SSH auth socket
The SSH auth socket is a Unix socket used by the SSH agent to communicate with other processes, allowing for secure key management. To use it with Docker, you can mount it as follows:

**macOS:**
```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$HOME/.ssh:/ssh:ro" \
  -v "$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts:/ssh/known_hosts:rw" \
  -v "$(pwd):/workdir" \
  -v "/run/host-services/ssh-auth.sock:/run/host-services/ssh-auth.sock" \
  -e SSH_AUTH_SOCK="/run/host-services/ssh-auth.sock" \
  serversideup/github-cli:latest gh --version
```

Notice how we're matching the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` to the host's socket. This is necessary for the SSH agent to communicate with the container.

**Linux:**
```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$HOME/.ssh:/ssh:ro" \
 -v "$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts:/ssh/known_hosts:rw" \
  -v "$(pwd):/workdir" \
  -v "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK:$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" \
  -e SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" \
  serversideup/github-cli:latest gh --version
```

### Environment Variables
You can customize the image easily with the following environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `PUID` | `1000` | Set the User ID that you'd like to run GitHub CLI as |
| `PGID` | `1000` | Set the Group ID that you'd like to run GitHub CLI as |
| `RUN_AS_USER` | `github` | The username you'd like to run GitHub CLI as (this will be created for you and will default to an **unprivileged** user) |
| `DEBUG` | `false` | Enable debug output of container startup |
